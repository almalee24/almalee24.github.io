My name is Alma and I love a good challenge. The latter is why I decided to learn about software development. While living in China in 2018, I first became introduced to Phyton. With my roommate's textbook, I taught myself a bit of Python when I had time. However, soon life got busy and Phyton got lost in the background. Fast forward to the end of 2019 in NYC,  I attend a JavaScript meetup and fell in love. But again life got busy and I didn't make time for it. Then COVID happened and I found myself without a job but with lots of free time. In these past few months, I've taught myself Javascript through different free resources and enjoyed it. However, there came a point where I realized I needed a bit more structure so I applied to Flatiron School. I'm really excited about this opportunity and the learning to come. So far programming has been incredibly fulfilling and a great challenge.
